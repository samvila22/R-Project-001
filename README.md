In this article, we'll be analyzing the results of 24578 NBA basketball games over the years 2004-2020. We'll be looking at statistics such as Home and Away Points, Home and Away Assists, Home and Away Rebounds, and Home and Away fg% and 3pfg% as well as comparing some of these sample statistics to their league average.

The main goal of this article is to assess whether the home team truly has an advantage over the away team in the NBA, as well as investigate whether scoring, rebounding, assisting, or efficiency is correlated or associated between both teams.
